Digital Temperature Sensor

Please see the wiki page for details on the codes provided. 

To properly set up the sensors, you must include a 4.7kOhm resistor between the data pin and the voltage pin. Failing to do so will cause it to read -27 for all temperatures. All sensors can be connected to the same pin. 

For the waterproof DS18B20, the red wire is for voltage, white is data, and black is ground. On a regular DS18B20, the pins are in the same order from left to right when looking at it from the front (rounded side). 

Please see the video or powerpoint for a visual representation of the circuit and sensor pins.
